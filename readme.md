## WebGL for busy people
There are lots of good good WebGL tutorials but this is the smallest amount of
code to get something on the screen&mdash;in one file&mdash;without wading
through lots of documentation

We're all busy people.

See it running on
[rawgit](https://rawgit.com/deanturpin/WebGL/master/index.html).
